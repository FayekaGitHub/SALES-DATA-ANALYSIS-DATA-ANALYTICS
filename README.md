### OVERVIEW 
I have conducted e-commerce data analysis using SQL, where I worked on extracting and analyzing various key metrics from the data. My analysis involved querying the database to track total number of orders and sales per category, revenue generated by each seller, top-selling products, cumulative sales per month, payment modes used by customers and also assess sales across different regions. Through these SQL-based insights, data-driven decisions can be made to optimize business strategies.
